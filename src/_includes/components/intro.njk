      Hi! I am Jørgen, and Green Heron is my one-man web agency<span class="period">.</span> I design and
      code websites from the ground up with the goal of having the process and
      product be as environmentally friendly as possible<span class="period">.</span>

      <h2 class="font-big">how I work</h2>
      <p>
        I use lightweight technologies and optimise code to minimise energy
        consumption, and hosting services that use green energy<span class="period">.</span> I design and
        code everything myself, which results in web pages that are:
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>sustainable</summary>
        I use techniques to reduce the energy consumption of the web pages that I make, like Static Site Generation, scoping fonts, solving problems with CSS rather than JavaScript, using code minimisers, and much more<span class="period">.</span> The resulting pages are very light on code and thus more energy efficient than pages made in for example Squarespace or Worpress<span class="period">.</span> <br/>In addition I use hosting services that use Green energy<span class="period">.</span>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>accessible</summary>
        I ensure that my sites are written with semantic HTML, and use relative font sizes, ensuring that the resulting pages are fully functional navigable for user with reduced vision or users whom use screen readers<span class="period">.</span>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>seo- performant</summary>
        Using Static Site Generation and semantic HTML results in good SEO scores<span class="period">.</span> The technique is inherently optimised for good search results<span class="period">.</span>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>fast</summary>
        Serving pages as static HTML, with minimal code bases and minimal use of JavaScript gives the servers and browsers minimal work to do and minimal data to parse at load time<span class="period">.</span> This results in very fast load and page speeds<span class="period">.</span>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>secure</summary>
        Static HTML is practically unhackable, and minimal JavaScript leaves no access points for maliscios actors<span class="period">.</span> SSL sertificates ensures security and spam protection server side<span class="period">.</span>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>future-proof</summary>
        Static HTML will pretty much last as long as we have browsers<span class="period">.</span> In addition my technique has very few dependencies, and the ones I do have I have hand-picked to be open source and available to ensure that no rganisational decisions or changes will impect the page performance reliability<span class="period">.</span>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>beautiful</summary>
        I have a background in fine art, and use my skills and creativity to make expressive, beautiful webpages with custom made assets<span class="period">.</span> I see my commitment to be environmentally friendly as a creative restriction to work within<span class="period">.</span> I love using the tools at my disposal in creative new ways<span class="period">.</span> All assets you see on my site are made by me<span class="period">.</span>
