        - Hi! I’m Jørgen, and Green Heron is my one-man web agency. I design and
          code websites from the ground up. It’s my goal to make the process and
          product as environmentally friendly as possible.
        - It's estimated[*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34553177/) that
          Information and Communication Technology is responsible for between
          2.1% to 3.9% of global CO2 emissions. In comparison, aviation is
          responsible for 2%. Efficient code, minimal data usage, and green
          energy will greatly reduce the environmental cost of using the
          internet.
        - I care deeply for community and nature. That’s why I wish to use my
          creative instinct and web development skills to help build a
          sustainable future.

      workingIntro: "I design and code everything myself, using lightweight
        technologies and optimising code to minimise energy consumption. I also
        use hosting services powered by green energy. The webpages I produce
        are:"

        - title: Sustainable
          content: |
           I use techniques that reduce the amount of energy used by a webpage. These include:
           - producing static sites
           - subsetting fonts
           - using CSS instead of JavaScript when possible
           - reducing the size of files through a process called code minifying
           - using efficient image formats
           - designing for reduced image use, fewer fonts on a page, and other data-reducing aspects
           
           With these techniques and more, I produce webpages that are very light on code compared to those made with well-known CMSs, such as Squarespace or WordPress, and more commonly used frameworks such as NextJS.
           
           Additionally, I use hosting services that run on green energy.
        - title: Custom designed
          content: I build personalised webpages with custom-made imagery for my clients. My design work draws on my background in Fine Art and my commitment to sustainability. I enjoy supporting my clients’ ideas in ways that prioritise energy efficiency. 
           All the design work on the Green Heron website was created by me. 
        - title: Accessible
          content: I write with semantic HTML and use relative font sizes. This results in fully functional and navigable webpages for screen readers and users with reduced vision. 
           My pages are also fully responsive.
        - title: SEO-performant
          content: Static site generation and semantic HTML result in good SEO scores. There’s no need to optimise the webpage any further.
        - title: Fast
          content: Using static HTML, with minimal code bases and minimal use of JavaScript, gives the servers and browsers less work to do and minimal data to parse at load time. This results in webpages that load quickly and have fast page speeds.
        - title: Secure
          content: Using static HTML and minimal JavaScript leaves no access points for malicious actors. My webpages have SSL certificates to ensure security and spam protection server side.
        - title: Future-proof
          content: Static HTML will pretty much last as long as we have browsers. In addition, my technique has very few dependencies. The ones I do have are hand-picked to be open source and available. This ensures that no organisational decisions or changes will impact the webpage's performance or availability.

            - Jørgen's designs were both visually appealing and highly
              functional, enhancing the user experience significantly.
            - Jørgen's iterative approach and ability to incorporate feedback
              ensured the project's success, especially on a site featuring 2000
              products. Additionally, his innovative prototype for a mobile menu
              system in Figma was a standout, demonstrating his proficiency and
              creativity in tackling usability challenges.
