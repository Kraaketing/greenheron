       -What is a green website? There are a few factors that come into play when developing for the web with sustainability in mind. This website is an example of the principles at play. They are:  
       Reducing the amount of energy used server side and client side  
       Smaller websites- Using Static site generation technology results in smaller webpages to send to the users. More efficient code -  
       CSS, not javascript  
       Hand coding and using my own library of components ensures smalles code bases for the webpages.  
       Using more efficient image formats   
       Using green energy hosting services  Where possible we can control the type of energy is consumed. This applies to the hosting Integrating the design process with the development process"
     - title: "Integrated Design"
       content: "An unique aspect of my services is that I both design and code the web pages, and I do so with the stated goal of sustainability. This means that the web pages have been designed with certain restrictions in mind, like reducing the code base with the goal of reducing energy consumption. <br/><br/> With my background in fine art, I use my skills in colour theory and composition in conjunction with my skills as a web developer to make beautiful, fast, secure and lightweight web pages. <br/><br/> I follow the latest tech developments to help me achieve this, where applicable, like using more efficient image formats, newly adapted colour values with wider colour gamuts, and so on. <br/><br/> One solution to using less (data- heavy) images has been to make my own custom assets, as can be seen around this site. <br/><br/> Custom coded webpages makes you free of the constraints of Content Management Systems (CMS) like Wordpress of Squarespace, and makes any design you want possible."
