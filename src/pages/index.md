          Hi! I am Jørgen, and Green Heron is my one-man web agency. I design and
          code websites from the ground up with the goal of having the process and
          product be as environmentally friendly as possible.

          It is [estimated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34553177/) that Information and Communication Technology is responsible for between 2.1% to 3.9% of global CO2 emissions. In comparison, aviation is responsible for 2%. How we use and make our technologies matter, and efficient code, minimal data usage, and green energy usage can make a big impact on the environmental cost of using the internet.
        - |
          I care deeply for the people and nature around us, and I wish to use my creative instinct and web development skills to be part of the change to a sustainable future.

      workingIntro: |
        I use lightweight technologies and optimise code to minimise energy
        consumption, and hosting services that use green energy. I design and
        code everything myself, which results in web pages that are:

        - title: "Sustainable"
          content: |
            I use techniques to reduce the energy consumption of the web pages that I make, like Static Site Generation, scoping fonts, solving problems with CSS rather than JavaScript, using code minifiers, and much more.
            The resulting pages are very light on code and thus much more energy efficient and performant compared to pages made in, for example, Squarespace or Wordpress.
            Additionally, I use hosting services that use green energy.
        - title: "Custom designed"
          content: |
            I have a background in fine art, and use my skills and creativity to make personalised webpages with custom made assets. I see my commitment to be environmentally friendly as a creative restriction to work within. I love using the tools at my disposal in creative new ways. All assets and design work you see on this site is done by me.
        - title: "Accessible"
          content: |
            I write with semantic HTML and use relative font sizes, this results in fully functional and navigable web pages for user with reduced vision, and users whom use screen readers. My pages are also fully responsive.
        - title: "SEO- performant"
          content: |
            Using Static Site Generation and semantic HTML results in good SEO scores. No need to optimise.
        - title: "Fast"
          content: |
            Serving pages as static HTML, with minimal code bases and minimal use of JavaScript, gives the servers and browsers minimal work to do and minimal data to parse at load time. This results in very fast load and page speeds.
        - title: "Secure"
          content: |
            Static HTML and minimal JavaScript usage leaves no access points for malicious actors. SSL certificates ensures security and spam protection server side.
        - title: "Future-proof"
          content: |
            Static HTML will pretty much last as long as we have browsers. In addition, my technique has very few dependencies, and the ones I do have are hand-picked to be open source and available to ensure that no organisational decisions or changes will impact the page performance or availability.

              I had the pleasure of working with and mentoring Jørgen at Vibe Digital,
              where he freelanced as a UI designer and Mid-level Frontend developer
              for 10 months. Jørgen's expertise and creative flair was clear from the
              outset, as he crafted the initial design for a major eCommerce website
              that our client immediately approved. His designs were both visually
              appealing and highly functional, enhancing the user experience
              significantly.
            - |
              Jørgen's iterative approach and ability to incorporate feedback ensured
              the project's success, especially on a site featuring 2000 products.
              Additionally, his innovative prototype for a mobile menu system in Figma
              was a standout, demonstrating his proficiency and creativity in tackling
              usability challenges.
            - |
              Reliable, professional, and creative, Jørgen consistently met deadlines
              and communicated effectively with myself and our clients. His
              collaborative spirit made him an invaluable member of the team. I highly
              recommend Jørgen for any UI design or Frontend developer role.
